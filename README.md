- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jibran-mohammad
Aspiring FullStack web developer with three months of experience, teaching Front end Development, Backend Development, and Artificial intelligence, using languages like Python, and Javascript, and databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.

I was born in India. I love to read and travel. I Volunteer regularly and am passionate about social good and technology. I have lived life with and without the Internet and technology. I prefer life with Technology. I want to help in bringing the technology to parts of the world where it's still growing or isn't present at all.

I appeared in GATE and got 95 percentile. It enabled me to have a deep understanding of computer science subjects like Algorithms, data structures, Computer networks, Databases, Operating Systems, compilers, Automata, etc.

Mtech enabled me to see what it feels like to be a researcher. Got hands-on experience in research and improved my understanding of core computer science Subjects by taking them to the next level.

I appeared in GATE and got 95 percentile. It enabled me to have a deep understanding of computer science in general.

Finally Excited to rejoin the industry!!
